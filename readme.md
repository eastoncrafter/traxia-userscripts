# Traxia Scripts Repository

### Homemade fresh baked userscripts for traxia, from SimpleConsign. It's a pos system ran completely in the web browser and is garbage for customizability. Everything takes multiple clicks, and when you're using a stupid pos mouse you'll drive yourself and your customers insane.  
### I made a couple scripts, should be easy enough to integrate into tampermonkey
